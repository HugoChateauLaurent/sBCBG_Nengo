# Abstract

Both old and new anatomical findings challenge mainstream theory of the basal ganglia circuitry and of how this structureperforms action selection. A new biologically plausible model of basal ganglia takes into account these findings. Here I proposeto compare this model with a simpler one which is in accordance with the mainstream theory. Both models will be used withinan existing cognitive architecture to perform a well-known naturalistic task, the Tower of Hanoi, and be evaluated according tobehavioural data from human studies. I believe it will be a good way to assess the functional performance of both models andthe need for biological plausibility in cognitive modelling. The cognitive architecture will also provide a good framework forstudying the relations between basal ganglia, high level cognition and movement disorders like Parkinson’s disease.
