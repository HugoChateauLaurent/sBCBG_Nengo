# Abstract

Mainstream theory of how human basal ganglia performs action selection has been challenged by anatomical findings. A new biologically plausible model has recently been developped. Here we argue that comparing this model with a simpler and less realistic one on a naturalistic task within a cognitive architecture is a good way to assess their functional performance and the need for biological plausibility. It also provides a good framework for studying the relations between basal ganglia, high level cognition and movement disorders.
