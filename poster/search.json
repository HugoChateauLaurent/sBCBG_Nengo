["Do you need biological plausibility? Hugo Chateau-Laurent Radboud University, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour Two models of basal ganglia are used to study the relationship between biological plausibility, performance and interpretability in cognitive modelling. Some anatomical fi ndings suggest a need to reevaluate the canonical theory of how basal ganglia may perform action selection. However, this theory is appealing in its simplicity and has given rise to e ﬃ cient computational models. A more detailed model is compared to shed light on the need for biological plausibility. A focus on basal ganglia Biological plausibility is an important criterion for evaluating models in neuroscience, while arti fi cial intelligence is more focused on e ﬃ ciency for enginering ends. However, simplicity is a common goal. In neuroscience, simple and general principles are more elegant than the bag of tricks hypothesis and can potentially unify multiple sub fi elds. Simplicity can also be the key to solve the interpretability concern in arti fi cial intelligence. Neural networks are black boxes and their application in high risks domains such as autonomous driving, robotics or law is therefore limited. In these domains, agents must be able to give full account of their actions through the interpretability of their decision making process. A simple theory of how humans make decisions would be bene fi cial to both fi elds. Abstract Motivation Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease is characterized by: Liénard et al. (2017) have shown that beta oscillations emerge when the dopamine is reduced in the STN-GPe loop only, while most studies focus on the depletion in the striatum. However, it is not yet clear how the disease impairs motor control. the death of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA and the SNc beta oscillations in the BG due to the lack of dopamine 15 30 15 30 Visual cortex BG Motor cortex Thalamus GPe GPi / SNr STN Thalamus Cortex IN Striatum D2 D1 VTA / SNc GPe GPi / SNr VTA / SNc STN Thalamus Cortex IN Striatum D1/D2 D2 D1 100% > 80% Indirect Direct BCBG (e.g. Gurney, Prescott, & Redgrave, 2001) Top-down BG models based on Albin (1989) (Liénard & Girard, 2014) Adapted from Girard (2019) Excitatory Inhibitory Dopamine Oscillations generated inside the STN/GPe loop do not impair action selection Action selection task The simulations have been performed in Nengo. A visual bu ff er is fed a stimulus that should either drive a ﬂ ee, fi ght or ﬂ ight motor response. The visual bu ff er is connected to the striatum through corticostriatal neurons. The GPi/SNr nuclei serve as output of basal ganglia and project to the thalamus which itself projects to a motor bu ff er. BCBG is compared to the model of Gurney et al. (2001). For engineering purposes, it seems more reasonable to use the model proposed by Gurney et al. (2001) or an even simpler Winner-Takes-All system. It is worth noting that BCBG is totally agnostic concerning the function of basal ganglia. Liénard & Girard (2014) have constrained the model on anatomical data only, and the selection capacities are ermergent. Therefore, BCBG will not be obsolete in case of paradigm shift. On the other hand, Gurney et al. (2001) followed a top-down approach to constrain their model with the assumption that basal ganglia perform action selection with segregated pathways.
